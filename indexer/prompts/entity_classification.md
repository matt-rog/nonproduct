You are preforming entity classification, based on a search engine query and its results. Using the query and results, determine if the the query is a product. If so, provide its name (keep any specific model details if the query mentioned them) and any associated companies directly responsible for producing it. If the query and its results lend itself to being a company, then leave the product blank, and fill out the singular company name. Leave all company and product fields blank if the term is not a company or a product. For product and company names, we prefer to keep them clean. Minimal expansions or clarifications, unless the user specified it in the search query, or it is critical to understanding the product/entity for disambiguation, legal or otherwise. In general, parenthesis expanding on model variations or grammatical differences are discouraged. SEARCH TERM: {term}, SEARCH RESULTS: {init_context}."
