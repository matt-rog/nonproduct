You are preforming entity classification, based on a search engine query and its results. Using the query and results, determine if the the query is a product. If so, provide its name (keep any specific model details if the query mentioned them) and any associated companies directly responsible for producing it. If the query and its results lend itself to being a company, then leave the product blank, and fill out the singular company name. Leave all company and product fields blank if the term is not a company or a product. Try to keep the extracted names as generic as possible, unless the term specified certain features or models. SEARCH TERM: {term}, SEARCH RESULTS: {init_context}."
